        <h2>This is a personal Game Development project inspired by my childhood hobby of creating origmami. The main idea is that all game elements will be based off of origami designs. The player will control an origami crane and attempt to complete levels through a series of puzzles. The specifics of the story have yet to be completed. This project primarily involves the programs Blender and Unity.</h2>
        <h3>Modeling in Blender</h3>
        <h2>In order to model accurate origami models, it was necessary to create those origami models to learn the fold patterns and the "theoretical" structure of the designs. In theoretical, I mean a design in which folding is precise and the thickness of the paper is 0. This is obviously congruent with modeling using a surface-based modelling system like blender. For each model, I started by folding the origami version of it myself. Next I unfolded the model to determine the fold patterns. These fold patterns were then translated into a face with all creases marked (see images right). I then used this information to ensure the scaling and proportionality of the models held in general. I opted for not truely folding the model within Blender using the rotate tool. Once the model was complete, it was ready to be animated.</h2>
        <h3>Animating in Blender</h3>
        <h2>I had previously been introduced to Blender animating in a Game Jam hosted by the Game Creation Club at The Ohio State University (GCC). Using a tutorial by [##VIDEO NAME##], I learned how to create armatures, weight painting, and posing. I attempted to animate a humanoid, which was difficult since humans can easily percieve anomilies in walking and running. As such, I knew sticking to non-humanoid origami figures would be feasile.</h2>
        <h2>First, an armature had to be created in a way that would most intuitively move the model. An important part of making the armature was making sure that a "root" bone existed. This way i could modify the transform of the model from within the animation rather than changing it in Unity.</h2>
        <h2>Next, each armature bone needed to be "assigned" to move a specific part of the model. This involved weight painting the verticies of the model for each bone on each model. This step is crucial, as if weight paints are incorrect, the armature may not react to pose changes as expected.</h2>
        <h2>Finally, each model needed to be posed on a timeline. Blender has features that easily blend between 2 poses over a certain amount of time, which simplifies animating considerably. However, during the start and end of an animation, the program tends to "pause" the movement momentarily in an attempt to blend the start of the animation with the end of the animation. This is usually undesired for animations that are intended to repeat as long as needed. This required me to manually change how Blender blends animations useing the [BLENDER ANIMATION BLEND GRAPH THING]. Once those sort of final tweaks are resolved, the model has 1 animation (see images left). The posing process is then repeated for any other movements that a model may need.</h2>
        <h3>Porting to Unity</h3>
        <h2>Unity and blender are mostly compatible, and the community of Belnder developers have made changes that have increased compatibility with Unity.</h2>
