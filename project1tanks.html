        <h2>With the help of <a href="https://tanks-encyclopedia.com/">Tank Encyclopedia</a> member Malik Cash and the awesome group of historians from <a href="https://tanks-encyclopedia.com/">Tank Encyclopedia</a>, I am collaborating to make a realistic tank simulation using calculations based on real world experiments with tanks.</h2>
        <h2>The project is NOT affiliated with <a href="https://tanks-encyclopedia.com/">Tank Encyclopedia</a> and was started by a developer known as OldRaven, who arrived at the idea from projects made by the YouTube Channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChhSsVCYHwhAX1GhhlwXIMQ">BoredEngineer</a>. OldRaven eventualy stopped working on project and passed it to Malik. Malik then contacted me through my brother Brian Gaydos's affiliation with <a href="https://tanks-encyclopedia.com/">Tank Encyclopedia</a>.</h2>
        <h2>Thus far, I have been tasked with implementing balistics for the existing tank model in the project, a rough Tiger I model. The starting point to this task was to determine the angle at which certain projectiles hit the armor of a tank in 3D space.</h2>
        <h3>Impact Angle calculation</h3>
        <h2>Knowing that raycasting would be essential to getting the correct collision of high-velocity projectiles in game, I assued that the projectile could be modeled by a raycast. First, I researched Unreal Engine to see if there was any way to get the normals a mesh's face that a raycast collided with, but I found no usable results. So I had to come up with an algorithm to determine the angle that a raycast made with a face. Originally, I came up with an algrithm that worked similarly to a linear search under the assumption that Unreal Engine could ray cast around 180 rays at once without serious performance side effects (this was clearly not the case). Essentially, the algorithm used the location of the ray's hit (determined by the engine), and found a position slightly away from that location (so that fucture raycasts do not also collide at the original collision location). It then raycasted in the opposite direction of the original raycast, but rotated by 1 degree (in 1 axis), moving clockwise until hitting the mesh face a second time. After hitting the mesh face a second time, the angle between the original raycast and the final raycast was calculated. Unfortunately, the algorithm only worked reasonably quickly when the calculated angle was around 20 degrees or less. And it could have an inaccuracy of up to 1 degree, which could be the diference between the projectile penetrating a tank, or bouncing off its armor.</h2>
        <h2>The various issues with my first method of angle calculation required me to create a better algorithm. Drawing from an algorithm I learned in my classes (Binary Search), I created a much faster and much more accurate way of calculating anlges. As one familiar with Binary Search may expect, the algorithm started by raycasting 90 degrees away from the original projectile's ray. If it hit the face, then it created a raycast halfway between the starting ray and the new 90 degree ray. It then continues to half appropriately for a certain amount of iterations determined by the client of the function. This algorithm ran much faster and gave extremely accurate results. Additionally, the algorithm could be tuned to be more accuracte with less performance or less accurate with more performance by changing the number of iterations it ran.</h2>
