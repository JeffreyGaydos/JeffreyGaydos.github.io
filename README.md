A wepage to display various smaller projects that don't fit with a resume, or more detail on those that do.

Currently re-working into a react website while maintaining the previous bootstrap version of the site.

see banner message on main site for the legacy site.

## Deploying

After you've made your changes and merged them with the primary branch, run `npm run deploy` to trigger a build and a push to the `gh-pages` branch. Eventually, GitHub's CDN will see this and publish the current contents of the site
